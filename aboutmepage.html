  <h3>My objective in life is to go to college and earn my degree in computer engineering. I will achieve my goal by taking a computer science at my high school, and taking out of school classes on science and high level math. I have always liked the idea of being able to take a computer apart and back together.</h3>
<h3>When I am working on a project, I talk to my partner about things we can put in the project because this make us work at a efficient speed. Working efficiently gives us time at the end to add or to fix things wrong with the project. This gives me and my partner a polished versinon of the projectand. </h3>   
<h3>As expressed my objective in life will be to obtain a computer engineering bachelor degree.The goal will be achieved by working hard with others and taking more classes for more to take more projects to get used to working in a new environment.</h3>
